# SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my SQL Practice Projects repository! 
This repo includes hands-on SQL scripts I wrote while learning and practicing SQL for academic projects and self-study.

Each script contains real-world database operations such as table creation, data insertion, joins, filtering, aggregation, and subqueries. Some projects also involve data transformation and reporting.


# Project Overview

| File Name         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_books_authors.sql`     | Creating and modifying `books` and `authors` tables, foreign keys, and data manipulation |
| `2_worker_data.sql`       | Employee data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using regex, string functions, and aggregation |
| `3_customer_orders_joins.sql` | Practice with subqueries, `IN`, `EXISTS`, and filtering customer order data |
| `4_customer_orders_joins_2.sql` | Repetition of join-based queries for practice; building on project 3 with similar structure |
| `5_bookstore_analysis.sql` | Advanced queries involving books, customers, sales trends, order items, and window functions |
| `6_final_project.sql`     | Final project using employee, product, and category data; includes groupings, calculations, and date-based logic |


# Skills Practiced

- Creating and altering SQL databases
- Data manipulation using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
- Data cleaning using `REGEXP_REPLACE`, `LOWER`, and trimming
- JOIN operations (`INNER`, `LEFT`)
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.)
- Subqueries and `EXISTS`
- Filtering with `LIKE`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `LIMIT`
- Date formatting and transformations
- Window functions (`RANK() OVER`)


# File Format

All SQL practice scripts are written in standard `.sql` format and are compatible with MySQL.


# Notes

- This repository is part of my internship and job application portfolio.
- Feel free to explore, give feedback, or use these scripts as learning material!
